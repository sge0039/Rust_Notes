DISABLING INLAY TYPE HINTS
"If you want to disable the inlay type hints (those little grey type annotations) that are added by the rust-analyzer extension, do the following:
1. Open the VSCode command prompt by pressing Command-Shift-P (Windows: Control-Shift-P) and search for 'settings json'
2. Find the option called 'Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)'. You want the one that says 'JSON', not 'UI'.
3. In the curly braces, add the following two lines and save the file:
  ""rust-analyzer.inlayHints.parameterHints.enable"": false,
  ""rust-analyzer.inlayHints.typeHints.enable"": false,"

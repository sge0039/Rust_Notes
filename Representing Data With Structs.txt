A good tool in rust to store some data and attach some functionality to is a Struct.
Structs are kind of like classes from other languages

Creating a struct:
struct Deck {
    cards: Vec<String>,
}

This can be broken down into different fields the struct can contain.

Deck: Name of the struct, always capitalised.
Cards: List of Fields (data) that this struct will wrap up.
Vec: Vector that will contain strings.
Vectors are like arrays that can grow/shrink in size. Rust also has 'arrays'. They are fixed lengths.

The struck is like a blueprint. The blueprint allows you to create many instances of the Deck struct. Each of these will have their own vector (list) of playing cards.
